LangGraph Deep Research Agent with Interactive Scoping and ReAct Search

This agent implements a two-phase workflow:
1. Interactive scoping phase: Engages with user to clarify research scope
2. ReAct research phase: Uses Tavily search to conduct comprehensive research

The agent accepts minimal state with just a 'messages' list containing a HumanMessage
and automatically initializes other required state fields.
